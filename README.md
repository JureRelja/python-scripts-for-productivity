# Overview

These are some pything scripts that I developed for the company I currently work for. My role in the company is Joomla website maintance, and my daily work consists mainly of posting new content that client send. Since, client are most public firms, the mostly send some legal papers which need to be posted on their website by the law.

# The problem

I noticed that I spend a lot of time, manualy renaming those files, converting them to .pdf, linking them on the website, etc. So I created a script which acts like a simle interface where the user (I in this case) can chose what he want to do with every file in his downloads directory. I can rename files, sort them, on convert them into .pdf without any manual work.

Another problem I had is with images. All the images that I post need to be maximally 1000px wide or tall (don't ask me why), and need to be named in numbering order (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.), otherwise they will be sorted randomly. I took me more than 15 minutes to rename and resize a batch of 50 images. Now with this script, it's automatically done in less than 5 seconds.

# End result

My estimate is that this scripts reduced my working time by at least 70%. There are still few things that I need to do manually, but 90% of it is automatic. I will definitely continue updating them in the future.
